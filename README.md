## Client Comparison

Telegram and Discord are recommended.

| | Telegram | Discord | Slack |
|---|---|---|---|
| Siri integration | Receive & Send | Receive only | Receive only |
| Multi-session support | One at a time (switchable) | Yes | Yes |
| Permissions required | Personal | Personal | Admin |
| Image support | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Quick Start (Telegram)

```bash
# 1. Create a bot with @BotFather on Telegram
#    - Send /newbot and follow the prompts
#    - Copy the bot token

# 2. Get your Chat ID
#    - Message your bot, then visit:
#    - https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates
#    - Find "chat":{"id":YOUR_CHAT_ID}

# 3. Configure and run
npx afk-code telegram setup   # Enter your credentials
npx afk-code telegram         # Start the bot

# 4. In another terminal, start a monitored Claude session
npx afk-code claude
```

## Quick Start (Discord)

```bash
# 1. Create a Discord app at https://discord.com/developers/applications
#    - Go to Bot → Reset Token → copy it
#    - Enable "Message Content Intent"
#    - Go to OAuth2 → URL Generator → select "bot" scope
#    - Select permissions: Send Messages, Manage Channels, Read Message History, Attach Files
#    - Open the generated URL to invite the bot

# 2. Get your User ID (enable Developer Mode, right-click your name → Copy User ID)

# 3. Configure and run
npx afk-code discord setup   # Enter your credentials
npx afk-code discord         # Start the bot

# 4. In another terminal, start a monitored Claude session
npx afk-code claude
```

## Quick Start (Slack)

```bash
# 1. Create a Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps
#    Click "Create New App" → "From manifest" → paste slack-manifest.json

# 2. Install to your workspace and get credentials:
#    - Bot Token (xoxb-...) from OAuth & Permissions
#    - App Token (xapp-...) from Basic Information → App-Level Tokens (needs connections:write)
#    - Your User ID from your Slack profile → "..." → Copy member ID

# 3. Configure and run
npx afk-code slack setup   # Enter your credentials
npx afk-code slack         # Start the bot

# 4. In another terminal, start a monitored Claude session
npx afk-code claude
```

A new channel is created for each session. Messages relay bidirectionally.

## Auto-Spawn Sessions from Discord

Instead of starting Claude from a terminal, you can create a channel directly in Discord:

1. Create a text channel named `claude-something` (any name starting with `claude-`)
2. Edit the channel topic to a directory path (e.g. `/home/dan/myproject`)
3. The bot validates the path, spawns `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` in that directory, and begins relaying messages
4. Type in the channel to send input to Claude
5. Delete the channel to kill the session

This lets you start Claude sessions entirely from Discord (or your phone) without needing terminal access.

## Image Support

When Claude references image paths in responses (e.g., `/path/to/screenshot.png`), the bot automatically detects and uploads them to the chat. Supports PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP, and other common formats.

## Commands

```
afk-code telegram setup          Configure Telegram credentials
afk-code telegram                Run the Telegram bot

## Installation Options

```bash
# Global install
npm install -g afk-code

# Or use npx (no install)
npx afk-code <command>

# Or run from source
git clone https://github.com/clharman/afk-code.git
cd afk-code && npm install
npm run dev -- slack
npm run dev -- claude
```

Requires Node.js 18+.

## Mock Discord Mode

For testing without a real Discord connection, run in mock mode:

```bash
npx afk-code discord --mock-discord
```

This starts an HTTP server on `localhost:3000` that simulates Discord events. All bot responses are logged to the terminal. Use curl to drive the full flow:

```bash
# Create a channel
curl -X POST localhost:3000/create-channel \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"claude-test"}'

# Set topic to spawn a Claude session
curl -X POST localhost:3000/change-topic \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"channelId":"mock-chan-1","topic":"/path/to/project"}'

# Send a message
curl -X POST localhost:3000/send-message \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"channelId":"mock-chan-1","content":"hello"}'

# Run a slash command (clear, interrupt, background, mode, compact, model opus)
curl -X POST localhost:3000/command \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"channelId":"mock-chan-1","command":"clear"}'
```

### Testing with mock-discord (for AI agents)

When making changes to session management, Discord integration, or tmux lifecycle code, **use the mock discord system to verify your changes** before considering the task complete. The mock system exercises the same `SessionManager`, channel state persistence, and tmux session lifecycle as the real Discord bot.

Start the mock server with `npm run build && node dist/cli/index.js discord --mock-discord`, then use the HTTP endpoints above to drive the flow. Use `GET /sessions` to inspect state and `tmux ls` to verify tmux session lifecycle. Shut down the server with SIGTERM to test graceful cleanup.

## How It Works

1. `afk-code slack`, `afk-code discord`, or `afk-code telegram` starts a bot that listens for sessions
2. `afk-code claude` spawns Claude in a PTY and connects to the bot via Unix socket
3. The bot watches Claude's JSONL files for messages and relays them to chat
4. Messages you send in chat are forwarded to the terminal
5. With auto-spawn (Discord), creating a `claude-*` channel and setting its topic to a directory spawns Claude directly — no terminal needed

## Limitations

- Does not support plan mode or responding to Claude Code's form-based questions (AskUserQuestion)
  - You can bypass this using the `/mode` command or by sending any message
- Does not send tool calls or results (would encounter rate limits)
